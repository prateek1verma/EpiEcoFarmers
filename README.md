# Epi-Eco-Farmers
Codes for the generation of Figures for the project 'EpiEcoFarmers'


### This code is associated with the paper titled "Farmers’ decision-making on fungicide treatment in multiple fields"


## Overview ##

This repository contains and all of the code and data required to reproduce the figures presented in: *Farmers’ decision-making on fungicide treatment in multiple fields*.

All the final figures are also included in the repository. The code included comes in two types:

1. Code for running numerical simulations and generating data (written in a mixture of Matlab and Python)
2. Code for loading the numerical simulation data and plotting it to reproduce the figures as shown in the text (written in Matlab and Python)

Analytical and numerical computations were performed using a combination of software packages and programming languages.
The primary software packages used for numerical simulations and solving systems of differential equations were Matlab (version R2022b), Python (version Python 3.11.3\prateek{??}).
Analytical expressions of the basic reproduction number $R_0$, fixed points, stability conditions of the fixed points were computed using Matlab's Symbolic Math Toolbox (version R2022b).
Mathematica (version X.X.X) was employed to verify the results of some analytical analysis.
