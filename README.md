# EpiEcoFarmers
Codes for the generation of Figures for the project 'EpiEcoFarmers'


### This code is associated with the paper titled "Farmers’ decision-making on fungicide treatment in multiple fields"


## Overview ##

This repository contains and all of the code and data required to reproduce the figures presented in: *Farmers’ decision-making on fungicide treatment in multiple fields*.

All the final figures are also included in the repository. The code included comes in two types:

1. Code for running numerical simulations and generating data (written in a mixture of Matlab and Python)
2. Code for loading the numerical simulation data and plotting it to reproduce the figures as shown in the text (written in Matlab and Python)
